## Monitoring & Tools

ULTRATHINK includes production-grade monitoring:

```python
from src.monitoring import MetricsLogger

# Track metrics
metrics = MetricsLogger(window_size=100)
metrics.log(loss, lr, model, batch_size, seq_length)
```

See [Testing Guide](../TESTING_GUIDE.md#monitoring--profiling) for details.
