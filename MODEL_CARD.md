### Hardware Requirements

| Model Size | Min GPU Memory | Recommended GPUs | Training Time* |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------------|

| Small | 16GB | 2x RTX 3090 | 3-5 days |
| Medium | 40GB | 4x A100 | 1 week |
| Large | 80GB | 8x A100 | 2 weeks |

*Approximate time for 100B tokens

## Evaluation

### Benchmarks

The model can be evaluated on:
- Perplexity (language modeling)
- LAMBADA (reading comprehension)
- HellaSwag (commonsense reasoning)
- MMLU (multitask understanding)
- HumanEval (code generation)

### Performance Metrics

Performance varies by model size and training duration. Baseline metrics:

```
Small model (350M, 50B tokens):
- WikiText perplexity: ~20
- LAMBADA accuracy: ~40%

Medium model (760M, 100B tokens):
- WikiText perplexity: ~15
- LAMBADA accuracy: ~50%
```

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations

- **Context Length**: Limited by computational resources (max 8192 tokens)
- **Inference Speed**: Large models require significant compute
- **Memory**: Full precision models need substantial GPU memory
- **Quantization**: May lose accuracy with aggressive quantization

### Model Limitations

- **Hallucination**: May generate plausible but incorrect information
- **Bias**: Inherits biases from training data
- **Temporal Knowledge**: Training data cutoff limits current knowledge
- **Reasoning**: Limited complex multi-step reasoning without DRE
- **Multimodal**: Vision/audio capabilities require additional training

### Safety Limitations

- Not trained specifically for harmlessness
- Constitutional AI layer provides basic safety but not foolproof
- Requires human oversight for sensitive applications
- May generate inappropriate content despite safety measures

## Ethical Considerations

### Bias and Fairness

- Training data may contain societal biases
- Model outputs should be reviewed for fairness
- Not suitable for applications requiring demographic parity
- Recommend bias evaluation before deployment

### Privacy

- Do not train on private or sensitive data without proper safeguards
- Model may memorize training data (though unlikely with proper training)
- Use differential privacy for sensitive applications

### Environmental Impact

- Training large models has significant carbon footprint
- Recommend using renewable energy for training
- Consider model efficiency vs. performance tradeoffs
- Share trained models to reduce redundant training

## Responsible Use Guidelines

### DO

✓ Evaluate model performance on your specific use case  
✓ Implement content filtering for user-facing applications  
✓ Provide transparency about AI-generated content  
✓ Monitor for misuse and unexpected behaviors  
✓ Keep models up-to-date with safety improvements  

### DON'T

✗ Deploy without testing on representative data  
✗ Use for high-stakes decisions without human oversight  
✗ Assume outputs are factually correct  
✗ Train on copyrighted data without permission  
✗ Use for generating harmful content
